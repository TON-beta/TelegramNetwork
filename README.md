WHAT IS TELEGRAM OPEN NETWORK?

Telegram Open Network (TON) is a blockchain platform of Telegram instant messaging system from the team of Pavel Durov.
The platform is protected by a built-in proxy and anonymizer. The list of services offered includes messaging, Gram cryptocurrency 
and many others.

First of all, TON means user-friendliness. The transactions that will take place on this blockchain do not require waiting and 
a large fee and are executed as quickly as Visa and Mastercard. The blockchain works on the principle of the Proof-of-stake protocol,
which makes transactions secure. The architecture consists of one blockchain and 292 additional networks. The blockchain will support 
sharding technology, which will speed up the generation of new blocks and increase the speed of transactions.
